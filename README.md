Advanced Programming I Project
# PonyBuilder

Each senior at the University of Montana Computer Science department must finish what are called our capstone courses. The first of these is Advanced Programming 1 where we are introduced to the much needed Design Patterns. Our Professor had us develop was she called the Food Storage system, which later could take food “orders”.

I developed what I affectionately called the "Pony Builder". 
 
This project is an amalgamation of multiple Design Patterns Including:
* Factory Pattern: For the creation of each food objects.
* Adapter Pattern: For the linking of "different" food classes.
* Template Design Pattern: For the controlled creation and mitigation of the interface.
* State Pattern: For the control of the order system individual states.
* Builder: Temporarily used as a requirement, removed as it was unnecessary.
